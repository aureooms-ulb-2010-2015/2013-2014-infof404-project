\subsection{Writing the files}
When the processors finish the last step is to write in the .ppm file. This could be done by two differents strategies.

\subsubsection{Random strategy}
When a processor finishes he directly writes in the ppm file. This method is not very efficient because it takes a whole disk block, flips one bit and writes it all back on the disck.

\subsubsection{Sequencial strategy}
When all processors are finished the pixels are written one by one. One pixel is the size of three disk block.
