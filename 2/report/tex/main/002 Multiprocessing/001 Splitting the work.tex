\subsection{Spliting the work}


In order to work on sevral processor the work has to be shared as equaly as possible between them. Each processor is assigned a range of the boolean array used in eratosthene's algorithm.\\Normaly with $n$ processors each one should work on a range $\frac{total\_count}{n}$ however it's much easier to calculate indexes in the ranges if they are of a size multiple of 2. The reason is the loop reading numbers in the range. It reads them two by two to identify easily which is after a jump of 2 and which is after a jump of 4 (see \ref{ame:two}).
