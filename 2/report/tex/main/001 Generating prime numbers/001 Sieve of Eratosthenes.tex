\subsection{Sieve of Eratosthenes}

The algorithm is quite simple. To generate prime numbers up to n, we mark all the non-prime numbers like so: for every number $\textit{i}$ from 2 to $\sqrt{n}$ mark all multiples of $\textit{i}$ greater or equal than $\textit{i}^{2}$ as non prime. To do that we can simply work with an array of boolean, if $\textit{array[i]}$ is true then we consider $\textit{i}$ as prime.\\More precisely: \ref{alg:1}
