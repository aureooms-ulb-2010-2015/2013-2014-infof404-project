\section{Generating prime numbers}

Several algorithms have been considered for implementation as part of this project. we mainly focused our attention on Eratosthene's, Pritchard's and Atkin's sieves. Although Pritchard and Atkin algorithms are part of the source code, we chose Eratosthene algorithm to generate prime numbers. This algorithm is easy to implement and has a time complexity of $\BigO{n.log(log (n))}$ Also Eratosthene's sieve does not lead to any false positive or negative. However we have brought to this algorithm some ameliorations described hereunder.
