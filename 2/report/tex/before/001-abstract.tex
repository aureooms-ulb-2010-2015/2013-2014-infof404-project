The following study describes in details our implementation of the multiprocessing computation and representation of the Ulam spiral. The Ulam spiral is a technique that is used to visualize prime numbers. The main idea is to put
all natural numbers on a grid into a spiral and then to highlight all primes. It is believed this representation could help to understand the distribution of prime numbers.
