Study of the performance of LLF scheduling algorithm on systems with periodic, synchronous tasks
and constrained deadlines.
We consider systems of n periodic, synchronous and independent tasks $\tau = \{\tau_1 , \tau_2 , \dots , \tau_n \}$
with constrained deadlines embedded on a uniprocessor device.
The work is divided in 3 parts: implementation of a LLF scheduling algorithm simulator, implementation of a system generator and study of LFF's performances.
