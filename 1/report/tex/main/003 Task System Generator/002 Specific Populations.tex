\subsection{Specific Populations}

In the previous section we exposed the way we chose to produce a uniform distribution of task systems.

This implementation will be used in \ref{sec:study} but we could ask ourselves if there is no other option.
It would be interesting to be able to study a specific population of task systems, this could be achieved with discrete non-uniform distributions of individual tasks.
