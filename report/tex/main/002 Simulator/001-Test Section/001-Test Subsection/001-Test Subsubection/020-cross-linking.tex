    Fermat’s principle states that the path light takes from one point 
    to another is not necessarily the one with the smallest distance,
    but rather the path which can be traversed in the shortest time.
    Geometrical optics is an approximation for light propagation in 
    cases where the wavelength is very small compared to the
    structures with which the light interacts. Snell’s Law, describing 
    refraction, can be derived from Fermat’s principle 
    (see \ref{sec:fermat} named \nameref{sec:fermat}).
