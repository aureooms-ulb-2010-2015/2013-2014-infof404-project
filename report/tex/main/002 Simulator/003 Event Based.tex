\subsection{Event based}

The event based scheduler can be easily obtained by modifying the time based scheduler, the only changes to make are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item adding an event priority queue
	\item adding triggers for events
	\item computing the $i$ steps as $i = hpe.i$ where $hpe$ is the \emph{highest priority event}
\end{enumerate}

An example of the differences of implementations can be seen in \ref{code:app:1} and \ref{code:app:2}.

The event loop can be seen in \ref{code:app:3}.
