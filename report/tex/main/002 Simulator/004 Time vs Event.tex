\subsection{Time vs Event}

There are pros and cons considering both implementations. Here are listed some observations:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The event based approach consumes more memory because of the (small) overhead of the event queue.
	\item The event based approach is much faster for $\Delta_r > 1$ (asymptotic $\Delta_r$ speed up factor).
	\item The time based approach makes way too many new job checks for long period tasks (1 check per time unit).
\end{enumerate}
